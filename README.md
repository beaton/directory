# The FINDER service

The Finder service is an Alexa Web Service built with Spring Boot that handles a variety of requests from an Alexa device through customer handlers. The HandlerSpeechlet class extends the Amazon Alexa SDK SpeechletV2 following a factory pattern to instantiate and respond to the request through the appropriate handler:

1. AMAZON.CancelIntent - maps to the AmazonCancelIntentHandler class
2. AMAZON.FallbackIntent - maps to the AmazonFallbackIntentHandler class
3. AMAZON.HelpIntent - maps to the AmazonHelpIntentHandler class
4. AMAZON.StopIntent - maps to the AmazonStopIntentHandler class

and,

5Â FindPeople - custom intent created to call a serivce.  In this case, it calls the Google Calendar service to then locate people via their Google Calendar (or any other service you imagine).

## Why not use a Lambda function?

This is a simple Java web application, built with Spring Boot.

Why would I use Spring boot over an AWS Lambda? Well ... I don't get to code much anymore and I wanted a reference implementation of both Spring boot AND an Alexa skill so this is about killing one bird with two stones. 

## Minimum configuration

1. java version "1.8.0_45" (build 1.8.0_45-b14)
2. Apache Maven 3.3.3

hint: if you have a mac, use homebrew to install the above.

## Build/Run

1. $ mvn clean install
2. $ mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively after calling mvn clean install, you can run the application locally in debug mode: java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n -jar target/directory-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war. I use Eclipse, which can then be easily connected to the running application through Debug Configurations and creating a Remote Java Application configuration.

Application configuration can be found under /src/main/resources/application.properties

## Supported REST endpoints

GET localhost:8080</br>
GET localhost:8080/snoop</br>
GET localhost:8080/health heartbeat endpoint to verify health.</br>
GET localhost:8080/quote Calls the Spring Boot random expression generator. This is just for fun.</br>
POST localhost:8080/find: Called from the com.youi.finder.alexa.config.Configuration servlet and is used to call the HandlerSpeechlet handler factory to process the Alexa request.  This is the endpoint you need to use in your alexa skill.</br>
